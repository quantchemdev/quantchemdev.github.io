    These few months, MSc Valerii Chuiko has visited our group. He is a current PhD student workin in the group of Dr. Paul W. Ayers.

<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 20px;">
    During his thesis, he has been working on Deep Learning for the prediction of the energy from one- and two-electron integrals. Now, he came to work on RDMFT. He presented two wonderful lectures in both of these topics, one of them in the KT Seminar talks organized in the DIPC!

    After these exhausting dates, we organised our well-known "sociedad", an informal dinner typical from Donostia. We had a wonderful time!
